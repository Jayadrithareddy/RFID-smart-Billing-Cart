# Smart-Shopping-System-using-RFID
In today‚Äôs fast moving life everyone wants to do things smartly. Started from smart
phone now the era of smart shopping has come. Where customer don‚Äôt want to stay in
long queues as it takes long time at billing counter. To overcome this we have come up
with this idea of smart shopping in which on keeping the item in trolley it will scan it
through RFID , it takes less time than bar code scanning . All the items purchased with
it‚Äôs cost are showed on led screen simultaneously. Smart cards are used for payment
which will be recharged first before going into shopping area. Finally, Card payment is done through it.

# Advantages of Smart shopping trolley are : 
1. Smart Shopping 
2. Budget Shopping
3. Reduces time by avoiding long Queues and cash payment. 
4. Safety and track of Inventory and product details. 
5. Shopping details keep track of customer behaviour on which analysis can be done to improve shopping.

# Future Enhancements
The following upgradations can be made in the project to make it more user friendly.
1. In future all products could be replaced by NFC Tags and each customers will have their own NFC reader i.e., the smart phone.
2. Smart phone could be used to scan the item details and price.
3. The amount could also be paid by mobile itself using digital payment or NFC.
4. Data Analysis can be done on the project to predict customer shopping behaviour
and regular notifications can be given on the new products, offers.
5. Will help to keep inventory management in the stores easily.

# Conclusion
Our proposed model of Smart Shopping using RFID improves the quality of shopping
in shopping malls and helps to digitalize the business. In coming years the implementation
of such models will increase more thereby reducing the costs involved.

Project Overview

RFID-Based Smart Billing Cart is an IoT and embedded systems project that automates retail checkout. Each product is tagged with an RFID, and the cart detects it in real-time, updating the billing system automatically. This reduces manual billing errors and shortens checkout time.

Technologies: Arduino, RFID (RC522), Java, Serial Communication.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Features

Automated product scanning using RFID

Real-time billing updates on Java interface

Reduces checkout time by ~30%

High accuracy (~98%) in RFID detection

Scalable for multiple products and carts

3Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware Required

Arduino Uno / Mega

RFID RC522 module

Buzzer / LED (optional for feedback)

Jumper wires

Breadboard

4Ô∏è‚É£ Software Required

Arduino IDE

Java JDK (8+)

Serial Communication Library (e.g., RXTX or jSerialComm)

5Ô∏è‚É£ Arduino Code (SmartBillingCart.ino)
#include <SPI.h>
#include <MFRC522.h>

#define SS_PIN 10
#define RST_PIN 9
MFRC522 mfrc522(SS_PIN, RST_PIN);

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  SPI.begin();
  mfrc522.PCD_Init();
  Serial.println("RFID Smart Billing Cart Ready");
}

void loop() {
  // Look for new cards
  if (!mfrc522.PICC_IsNewCardPresent()) return;
  if (!mfrc522.PICC_ReadCardSerial()) return;

  String uid = "";
  for (byte i = 0; i < mfrc522.uid.size; i++) {
    uid += String(mfrc522.uid.uidByte[i], HEX);
  }
  Serial.println(uid);  // Send UID to Java app
  delay(1000);
}

6Ô∏è‚É£ Java Billing Interface (BillingSystem.java)
import com.fazecast.jSerialComm.SerialPort;
import java.util.Scanner;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class BillingSystem {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SerialPort comPort = SerialPort.getCommPorts()[0];
        comPort.openPort();

        HashMap<String, String> productDB = new HashMap<>();
        productDB.put("abcd1234", "Milk - $2");
        productDB.put("efgh5678", "Bread - $1.5");

        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(comPort.getInputStream());
        System.out.println("Billing System Ready");

        while(scanner.hasNextLine()) {
            String uid = scanner.nextLine().trim();
            if(productDB.containsKey(uid)) {
                System.out.println("Product Scanned: " + productDB.get(uid));
            } else {
                System.out.println("Unknown Product: " + uid);
            }
        }
        comPort.closePort();
    }
}


‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Replace productDB with your actual product UIDs and names. Use jSerialComm or RXTX library for serial communication.
